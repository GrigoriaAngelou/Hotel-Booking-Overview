        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">The dashboard below uses a dataset in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1" target="_blank">kaggle.com</a>&nbsp;which&nbsp;contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.
        </p>
        <h2 class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-3">Explaining the purpose of this dashboard </h2>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-4">Making this dashboard I wanted to answers questions like:<br>1. How well each type of hotel performs, for instance are there many cancellations compared to the bookings that they have? Or from which country most bookings come from?<br>2. I would also, like to have a comparison between the two hotel types to see how different the customers behave in those.<br>3. And lastly, I would like to know the demographic differences of those hotel types. I made 5 different parameters (2 adults with kids, 1 adult with kids, 2 adults, solo traveler, no informations) based on the number of adults and children that every room had to see the behavior of easvh customer type on the reservation status.<br>
