# Hotel Booking Overview

In this project I used a dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand <br>
It contains different informations about two hotel types (City Hotels and Resort Hotels.)
<br>

I made a cleaning in the dataset and a basic eda using few data visualizations. <br>
I moreover, made a dashboard where I filtered the data to City Hotels and Resort Hotels, where I added a basic overview for each type, then I compared them
to see their performance in different fields and then I made a demographic analysis with the informations that I had about the customers of each hotel type.
