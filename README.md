# Hotel Booking Overview

In this project I used a dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand <br>
It contains different informations about two hotel types (City Hotels and Resort Hotels.)
<br>

I made a cleaning in the dataset and a basic eda using few data visualizations. You can find it here **Code:** https://github.com/GrigoriaAngelou/Hotel-Booking-Overview/blob/main/hotel-booking-demand-clean-data-basic-analysis.ipynb
